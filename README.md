# Monarch Money Amazon Connector

Monarch Money Amazon Connector automatically adds
a note to each Amazon transaction in Monarch Money containing
the list of items ordered.

Why?

To make it easier to categorize Amazon transactions, eliminating
the need to go order-by-order to find the matching transaction
in your Amazon Account.
